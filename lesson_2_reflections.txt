What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
----
   When we initialize a repository, git will create a .git folder. we need to initialize it to make the
 directory a git repository so that git can track the changes and maintain version as a repository.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 ----
 	Working directory represet where all the current file is there. Staging are is a place where git will store all
 the file that user has cahnged and want to make part of commit which represetn a single logic. repository is like
 snapshot of all the file after git commit had issued. 
 Staging area is used to specify set of file modified which represent the a single logic. so when we see the log,
 it easy to search for a file which might have cause the error by looking into commit message and modified file.
